### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science and Technology at Southeast University. 
- 🌱 My study interests lie in **model compression** and **lightweight training** in **large language models (LLMs)** and **knowledge graphs (KGs)**.
- ❤️ Love programming and new technologies!
- 👯 Enjoy doing interesting work with interesting friends!
