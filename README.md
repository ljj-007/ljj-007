### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science and Technology at Southeast University. 
- 🌱 My study interests lie in **lightweight training and deployment** for large models (such as **LLMs** and high-dimension **knowledge graph embedding models**).
- ❤️ Love Programming and Math!
- 👯 Enjoy doing interesting work with interesting friends!
