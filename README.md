### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science and Technology at Southeast University. 
- 🌱 My study interests lie in **lightweight training and deployment** for large models (such as LLMs and high-dimension KGE models).
- 👯 I enjoy doing interesting work with interesting friends!
